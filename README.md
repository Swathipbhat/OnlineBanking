### ABOUT THIS PROJECT âœ…
    The system is an online banking application that can be accessed with the proper login details.The main objective of our project is to provide more security while performing online transactions by providing efficient authentication etc. In the existing system, we can perform all the operations using a single user id and password

Once a user logs in he or she can check the bank balance, check bank account transaction history or account summary, add beneficiary accounts, transfer funds to another account, download account summary. The customer using the online banking service would be given a user id along with two other passwords. One called Login Password and the other called transaction password. By using login password the customer can login to their account and we can perform only some (limited) operations like viewing A/C balance and personal details etc. But to perform a transfer or online transaction, the user needs to provide the transaction password and other secure information in order to complete the transaction successfully.
